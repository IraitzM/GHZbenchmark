# GHZ benchmark

Simple code samples benchmarking GHZ state executions on different devices. We will showcase several ways in which we can interact with difference service provided to implement our algorithms. In order to maintain the code homogeneous, Qiskit will be used but we will see it does not matter if direct service providers are used (IBM in our examples) or intermediary cloud service providers (Azure, AWS), hardware knowledge needs to be put into value in order to obtain good results.
